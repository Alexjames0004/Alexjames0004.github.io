	    <p><strong>HEY MAN, WHY DO YOU CALL IT "KILL YOURSELF?" THAT'S OFFENSIVE!</strong></p>
	    <br>
	       People suck, plain and simple. I hear it everyday, "oh my god, i have 
    split ends," or "i broke a nail," or "my teacher is giving me a B, what
    will I ever do?," or "he was making fun of me." Sure everyone has feel-
    ings and express them in a different way, but I don't wanna hear your
    bitching and complaining because I don't care. In addition, "why isn't 
    pot legal? that's so dumb," or "jesus, they should get rid of that law." 
    If you want that law to go away, peel your dingleberry ass off the love 
    seat and organize people, do something, anything. If you are that 
    concerned with losing fifty cents KILL YOURSELF!
